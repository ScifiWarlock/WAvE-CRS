# WAvEAICODE
BEFORE YOU RUN INSTALL THE FOLLOWING MODULES THROUGH CMD PROMPT/TERMINAL/POWERSHELL: pygame, roboflow, keyboard
DO NOT SHARE API KEY WITH ANYONE OUTSIDE WAvE! IF YOU WANT TO SHARE THE CODE, DELETE THE API KEY SO NO ONE ELSE HAS ACCESS TO THE MODEL
MAKE SURE YOU HAVE ALL FILES DOWNLOADED BEFORE RUNNING THE CODE AND ENSURE YOU ARE NOT ON PYTHON VERSION 3.12 SINCE YOU WILL HAVE TO USE A VENV SINCE GPUTIL PACKAGES ARE NO LONGER SUPPORTED
IF YOU DO GET AN ERROR RELATED TO GPUTIL WHEN DOWNLOADING ANY OF THE MODULES, REMOVE ANY EXISTING VERSIONS OF PYTHON AND DOWNLOAD PYTHON VERSION 3.11

NOTE PLS NOTE: IF YOUR DEVICE DOES NOT HAVE A BUILTIN CAMERA, SIMPLY DOWNLOAD THE CAMO APP ON YOUR DEVICE AND AN ALTERNATIVE DEVICE YOU WANT TO USE AND MAKE SURE THE DEVICES ARE CONNECTED BEFORE RUNNING THE MAIN PYTHON FILE
